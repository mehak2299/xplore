Using es6(ES2015) Destructuring assignment
//JavaScript program to swap two variables

//take input from the users
let a = prompt('Enter the first variable: ');
let b = prompt('Enter the second variable: ');

//using destructuring assignment
[a, b] = [b, a];

console.log(`The value of a after swapping: ${a}`);
console.log(`The value of b after swapping: ${b}`);
Output

Enter the first variable: 4
Enter the second variable: 2
The value of a after swapping: 2
The value of b after swapping: 4
Here, a new es6 feature, called destructuring assignment [a, b] = [b, a], is used to swap the value of two variables. If [a, b] = [1, 2, 3], the value of a will be 1 and value of b will be 2.

First a temporary array [b, a] is created. Here the value of [b, a] will be [2, 4].
The destructuring of the array is done, i.e [a, b] = [2, 4].
As a result, the value of the variables are swapped.

Example 4: Using Bitwise XOR operator
//JavaScript program to swap two variables

//take input from the users
let a = prompt('Enter the first variable: ');
let b = prompt('Enter the second variable: ');

// XOR operator
a = a ^ b
b = a ^ b
a = a ^ b

console.log(`The value of a after swapping: ${a}`);
console.log(`The value of b after swapping: ${b}`);
Output

Enter the first variable: 4
Enter the second variable: 2
The value of a after swapping: 2
The value of b after swapping: 4
Bitwise XOR operator evaluates to true if both operands are different. To learn more about bitwise operators, visit JavaScript Bitwise Operators.

Let's see how the above program swaps values. Initially, a is 4 and b is 2.

a = a ^ b assigns the value 4 ^ 2 to a (now 6).
b = a ^ b assigns the value 6 ^ 2 to b (now 4).
a = a ^ b assign the value 6 ^ 4 to a (now 2).
Finally, a is 2 and b is 4.
